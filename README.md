(Extremely progressed but not 100% complete) Disassembly of Mega Man 4

Specifically for use with NESASM (https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm), this will reassemble into a byte-for-byte perfect clone of Mega Man 4 US (PRG0)

I remember having worked on this disassembly back in 2015 with intent to make something out of it after 3Mix, but the project wound up fizzling out. One of those things I kept thinking I'd come back to, now it's years later and I kinda just rediscovered it. What surprised me is how much I got done, so I figured there's no reason to continue having it collecting dust, hidden away.

I have no plans to do anything with it at this time, to finish up the gaps, or do some in-depth documentation like I did with SMB3. (Maybe someone else will?) Also it was an accident that I used PRG0 instead of PRG1, as I'd normally have preferred the latter revision, but it is what it is.

To assemble, simply run:

nesasm mm4.asm
